# AP_Music_player_project

A project for the subject **Advanced Programming** about a music player called **"Navak"**

---

## Features:

### An account based app:
Create as many accounts as you wish! All it takes is your email/phone number, a password of your own choice and a username of your own choice as well!  
Once done, you are good to go and will be moved into

---

### A tab based library:
Add any song from your phone into the app and create playlists. If you really like some songs why not like them to transport them to the *"liked tab"*?  
Enjoy listening to music :D

---

### Fairly customizable settings:
Did you forget your password? Did you by any chance want to isolate yourself from people so that they don't send you their stupid songs? Fear not as the **_Settings page_** will get this done. Enter your new account name/password/email/phone to change your information and in case you want to be a private person, just check the checkbox below so people stop sending you their songs.

### Vibe

## How to get the app working

1. Clone the repository.

   Within *Edit Configurations*, in the VM options add the command below:

   --add-opens java.base/java.time=ALL-UNNAMED
   ```
   and copy the IPv4 attribute and paste it everywhere that has a socket within main.dart.

```ipconfig```
4. Enjoy the show
