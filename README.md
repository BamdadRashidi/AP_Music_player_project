# AP_Music_player_project
A project for the subject **Advanced Programming** about a music player called **"Navak"**

---

## Features:

### An account-based app
Create as many accounts as you wish! All it takes is your email/phone number, a password of your choice, and a username of your choice as well!  
Once done, you are good to go and will be moved into...

---

### A tab-based library
Add any song from your phone into the app and create playlists. If you really like some songs, why not like them to transport them to the *"Liked tab"*?  
Enjoy listening to music :D

---

### Fairly customizable settings
Did you forget your password? Did you want to isolate yourself from people so they don't send you their songs? Fear not â€” the **Settings page** will get this done.  

- Enter your new account name/password/email/phone to change your information.  
- In case you want to be a private person, just check the checkbox below so people stop sending you their songs.
